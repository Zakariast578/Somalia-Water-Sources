# Somalia Water Sources Data Analysis  
### **Univariate • Bivariate • Multivariate Analysis + Visualization (Jupyter Notebook)**

This project focuses on analyzing **Somalia’s water sources** using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.  
The dataset contains detailed attributes of water points across multiple regions, enabling exploration of:

- Water availability  
- Functionality status  
- Geographic distribution  
- Infrastructure characteristics  

The goal of this project is to extract insights through multiple analytical stages.

## 🔍 **Project Objectives**

### **1️⃣ Univariate Analysis**
Explore each variable independently to understand:
- Value distributions  
- Frequency counts  
- Missing data  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Outliers  

---

### **2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis**
Examine relationships between two variables, including:
- Water source type vs region  
- Functionality vs district  
- Depth vs yield  
- Distance vs community size  

---

### **3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis**
Understand complex interactions across multiple features:
- Correlation matrix  
- Multivariate relationships  
- Combined variable effects  
- Initial insights useful for ML modeling or geographic planning

## 📊 **Data Visualization**
All visualizations are done using **Matplotlib**, following clean practices:
- One chart per figure  
- No seaborn (unless added manually)  
- Simple, readable layout  
- Suitable for reports and presentations  

Visualization types include:
- Bar charts  
- Histograms  
- Scatter plots  
- Boxplots  
- Correlation heatmaps
